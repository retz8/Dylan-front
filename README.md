## Description
Dylan is a coding assistant chatbot, supporting a comprehensive understanding of the GitHub Repository. Developed and presented on 24 MHacks x Google Hackathon.

**Dev Period:** 2024.04 ~ 2024.05  
**Team:** 1 Frontend Developer (Me), 2 Backend Developer

## Motivation
While I was using ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini... to support my coding project, I realized I was copying and pasting code snippets from VSCode to the website. However, most of the time, identifying bugs requires a comprehensive understanding of different files, folder structure, and their dependencies. With powerful Gemini 1.5 API, I decided to develop this powerful assistant that respond based on full codes from the GitHub repository!

## Contributions
### Development
- Designed and Implemented the UI of a chatbot, such as a modern Sign In, conversation interface, and form design
- Integrated NextUI and Acceternity UI libraries for faster component development
- Utilized Context API to manage session and authentication status
- Connected frontend with Flask REST API to generate AI response and Firebase(Firestore) to save chat histories
